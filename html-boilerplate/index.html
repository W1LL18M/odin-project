        <h3>Introduction to the Project</h3>

        <!-- strong makes text bold while em makes text italic -->

        <p><strong>The Odin Project</strong> is one of those <em>"What I wish I had when I was learning"</em> resources. Not everyone has access to a 
            computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and <strong><em>neither of those is right for 
            everyone anyway</em></strong>. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but 
            still want a high quality education.</p>
