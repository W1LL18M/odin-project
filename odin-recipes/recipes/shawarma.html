    <h1>Easy Beef Shawarma Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Shawarma is a Levantine Arab meat preparation, where meat is placed on a spit and may be grilled 
        for as long as a day. Shawarma can be served with various toppings and vegetables such as tahini, 
        hummus, amba, or pickled cucumbers. It is mostly wrapped in pita bread. As most of us don't have 
        a rotating spit at homes, this recipe is cooked on the stovetop. After all, in this fast life who 
        is gonna wait for a whole day?</p>

    <p>This is a wonderful Middle Eastern dish that I was introduced to by a friend of mine from Lebanon. 
        This recipe yields an absolutely amazing tasting and tender final product. Shawarma can be used 
        in pitas, be put on fattoush, on hommus, or eaten plain.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <h4>Shawarma:</h4>
        <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound beef top sirloin, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon shawarma seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

        <h4>Tahini Sauce:</h4>
        <li>½ cup tahini</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>2 tomatoes, halved and sliced</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add beef, shawarma seasoning, 
            allspice, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, turning occasionally, until beef is browned 
            and tender, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk tahini, yogurt, lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a small bowl 
            until creamy.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons tahini sauce in the center of each tortilla. Divide beef 
            slices, tomato slices, and onion slices evenly among tortillas. Roll up tortillas.</li>
        <li>Preheat a panini press according to manufacturer's instructions. Press rolled tortillas 
            seam side-down until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes. Cut each tortilla into 4 to 5 pieces.</li>
